Searching for previous installation of PCET...
Adding search paths for PCET functions...
 
Your MATLAB installation does not allow the saving of the updated MATLAB path variable.
This means that you have to add the PCET folder and all its subfolders to the MATLAB
path each time you start MATLAB or run this script using the option installPCET('path'),
which does that without testing external tools that might be required or other toolboxes.
 
Press any key to continue.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Determining versions of installed toolboxes (this might take few seconds) ...

Checking "MATLAB" installation ...  OK! Installed version: 9.0
Checking "Symbolic Math Toolbox" installation ...  OK! Installed version: 7.0
Checking "Optimization Toolbox" installation ...  OK! Installed version: 7.4

Note: You might have to restart Matlab once in order to 
refresh help paths and to use the PCET documentation.
